# Financial-Risk-Analysis

## Project Overview:
This project aims to predict loan defaults using machine learning algorithms. It involves analyzing client profiles and financial data to understand the relationship between various factors and loan default probability.

## Data Description:
The dataset used in this project consists of application data and previous application data. The data underwent preprocessing steps to handle missing values and categorical variables. It includes features such as demographics, income, debt levels, education, and employment status.

## Machine Learning Model:
Several machine learning algorithms were utilized for loan prediction, including logistic regression, Decision forest, etc. The models were trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Client Profile Analysis:
### Default Rates Across Demographic Groups:
An analysis was conducted to examine how default rates vary across different demographic groups within client profiles.

### Educational and Employment Patterns:
The project explored specific educational or employment patterns associated with higher default risk among loan applicants.

### Differences in Client Profiles:
An investigation was carried out to identify differences in client profiles between those with payment difficulties and those without.

### Income to Debt Ratio:
Income to debt ratios were calculated to assess the financial health of loan applicants.

## Financial Analysis:
### Relationship between Income, Debt Levels, and Default Probability:
The project analyzed the relationship between income, debt levels, and loan default probability to understand their impact on loan repayment.

### Income Distribution and Loan Amounts:
An examination of income distribution among loan applicants was conducted to analyze its influence on loan amounts and approval rates.

### Loan Amount vs. Income Levels:
The loan amount requested by clients was compared to their income levels to determine its impact on default rates.


## Usage Instructions:
To run the Python files in this repository, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. Detailed instructions can be found in the respective Python files.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project provides insights into loan default prediction and client profile analysis. It highlights the importance of various factors such as demographics, income, and debt levels in assessing loan default probability.

Future Work:
Potential areas for future work include exploring additional features, refining machine learning models, and conducting more in-depth analysis on specific demographic groups.
